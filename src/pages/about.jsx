                I am an engineering leader responsible for managing a UI team focused
                on delivering A/B tests and new front end features. I also founded
                and lead the Vivid Women in Tech organization, which provides
                leadership opportunities, professional development, community,
                external outreach for women in the tech organization.

                Orchestra performances. I also spend a lot of time with my
                loving, orange tabby cat, Howie.

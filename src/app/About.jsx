        <p>
            I am an engineering leader responsible managing a UI team focused on
            delivering A/B tests and new front end features. I also founded and lead
            the Vivid Women in Tech organization, which provides leadership and
            learning opportunities for women and promotes community and equality in
            the workplace.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my free time, I enjoy playing Beethoven and Chopin on the piano
            and spending time with my loving, orange tabby cat, Howie.

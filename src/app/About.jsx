        <p>
            I am an engineering leader responsible for managing a UI team focused
             on delivering A/B tests and new front end features. I also founded
              and lead the Vivid Women in Tech organization, which provides
              leadership opportunities, professional development, community,
              external outreach for women in the tech organization.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my free time, I enjoy playing Beethoven and Chopin on the piano
            and spending time with my loving, orange tabby cat, Howie.
